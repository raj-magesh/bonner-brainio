# Bonner Lab BrainIO

This is an implementation of the [BrainIO specification](https://github.com/brain-score/brainio/blob/main/docs/SPECIFICATION.md).

## Environment variables

`BRAINIO_HOME`

## Design considerations

- Simplicity: avoid features we in the Bonner Lab won't use
- Conformity: follow the BrainIO specification exactly
- Extensibility: don't create complex data structures beyond those provided by standard libraries
